20 PRINT "Helloooooooooooooo, world!"<br>
30 PRINT "I'm making the sample program clear and understandable."<br>
40 PRINT "This text is being printed via the PRINT command."<br>
50 PRINT "On the next line, I'll use CLS, which will clear everything I just printed, so you won't even see the preceding text." <br>
55 PRINT "Also, you can't give CLS a line to PRINT; it won't actually do anything"<br>
60 CLS "These words actually do nothing; they do not PRINT or anything."<br>
70 PRINT "Finally, on line 80, I'll use END, which will keep me from reaching line 90."<br>
80 END "Like CLS, putting a string here does nothing; it does not PRINT or anything."<br>
90 PRINT "this is not really my answer."<br>
